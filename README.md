# Heart Disease Classification Model Using Public Health Data 
## Objective: Develop a machine learning model for disease classification. 
## About Dataset: Using UCI Machine Learning Repository's healthcare datasets, which include patient data for various heart diseases. ●
Task: ● Preprocess the dataset for ML model training.
● Implement a classification algorithm (like decision trees or logistic regression).
● Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
